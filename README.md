# GtekOutagesMap

Development started on 7/8/2024. Finished 7/23. Creating a new Gtek Outages Map using Flask Framework.

Hosted through Google Cloud Run at https://gtek-outage-map-jve5426tsq-vp.a.run.app/ using Google Maps APIs

### Potential Future Improvements:
- Ping Visp / WUG and see what the customer's status actually is, instead of doing a distance calc to nearby towers
- seperate API key for server / client
- Allow customer to possibly log in and see status
- Use less default Bootstrap Formating
- Add an FAQ section
- Fix autofill on phones, allow for partial matches when cx puts in an address
- Security?
